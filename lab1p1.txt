Commands Used in gdb:
1. tui layout split / layout split / tui new-layout split {-horizontal src 1 asm 1} 2 status 0 cmd 1
    - I am a visual person, so seeing the code in front of me helps me better understand
    what is going on in the code and see how it is working. Using the tui layout split
    command gives me a visual of the code in C and also the assembly code used, so I can see
    where I am in the code. Depending on your terminal, the tui commands can change.

2. break main
    - To start debugging this program, I needed to start somewhere, and since main() is the
    only function header, we can start there. So by stating 'break main', we instantiate a break
    in the first line of main() for use in our step by step debugging.

3. run or r
    - The next step of debugging is making sure we are running the program. We use run, or
    just r for short, to begin execution. Because of the breakpoint we put in at main(), the
    program will start there.

4. next/nexti
    - next is the command that will take us to the next call in the code, so that we can step
    through the code and make sure each command is doing what we need it to do. nexti is a call
    we can make to observe each assembly instruction abstracted by a call or function in C.

5. step
    - step is an instruction I used to step into the square call. If you just use next, then
    the debugger will skip the steps that are done within the function call. Utilizing step
    can be helpful to ensure the internals of a function are functioning, no pun intended, as
    expected.
